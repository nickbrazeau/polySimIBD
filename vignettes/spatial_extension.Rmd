# Extending the Model for Space
We extend the discrete-loci, discrete-time structured Wright Fisher model for space by considering spatial _demes_ as a collection of hosts, where each host is a "micro-deme" in order to model complexity of infection.

![Schematic of the Spatial DL-DT sWF Malaria Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickbrazeau/polySimIBD/master/R_ignore/images/spatial_sWFmodelframework.png){width=500px}
</p>



As can be seen from the schematic, demes are a collection of hosts that can interact (i.e. hosts can move from deme to deme) based on the user-specified _Migration Matrix_, parameterized here as $M$. As before, within demes the complexity of infection is modeled as a probability of (internal) migration, $m$, which parameterized the spectrum of Cotranmission to Superinfection.


# Island Case
Here, we will make a dummy case of two island populations (population A vs. B) that are only marginally connected.   

Run the simulation:   
```{r}
# vectors must be ordered for population A and B
demesizes <- c(10, 15)
coimeans <- c(1.25, 1.25)
m <- c(0.25, 0.25)
migr_dist_mat <- matrix(0, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
diag(migr_dist_mat) <- 100
swf <- polySimIBD::sim_swf(pos = sample(1:1e3, size = 50), 
                           N = demesizes, 
                           m = m, 
                           mean_coi = coimeans, 
                           migr_dist_mat = migr_dist_mat, 
                           rho = 1e-2, 
                           tlim = 10)
```
Pull out the ARG and then calculate the pairwise IBD.
```{r}
ARG <- polySimIBD::get_arg(swf)

# here we are going to get all the pairwise IBD combinations for our hosts
adj_graph <- t(combn(x = c(1:sum(demesizes)), m = 2)) %>% 
  tibble::as_tibble(., .name_repair = "minimal") %>% 
  magrittr::set_colnames(c("smpl1", "smpl2")) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(pairwiseIBD = purrr::map2_dbl(.x = smpl1, .y = smpl2, .f = function(x,  y){
    polySimIBD::quiet(
      polySimIBD::get_realized_pairwise_ibd(swf = swf, host_index = c(x,y))
    )
  }))

```

Let's visualize our simple scenarios
```{r}
# for aesthetics
pop_assignments <- tibble::tibble(name =  as.character(1:sum(demesizes)),
                                  pop = rep(c("A", "B"), times = demesizes))

# convert to network for easy plotting
ibdnet <- tidygraph::as_tbl_graph(adj_graph, directed = FALSE)
ibdnet %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(community = as.factor(tidygraph::group_louvain())) %>% 
  tidygraph::activate("nodes") %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(., pop_assignments, by = "name")  %>% 
    ggraph::ggraph(layout = 'kk') + 
    ggraph::geom_node_point(aes(color = pop, shape = community), 
                            size = 3) +
    ggraph::geom_edge_link(aes(size = pairwiseIBD), 
                           alpha = 0.25) + 
    ggraph::theme_graph()

```
