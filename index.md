The goal of `polySimIBD` is to perform forwards in-time simulation of malaria population genetics. The model uses a discrete-time, discrete-loci structured Wright Fisher approximation to account for (simplified) malaria transmission dynamics.  

As of version 0.6.0, the model can incorporate a migration matrix and spatial factor. 

Please see our vigenettes for further details on the model formulation and how to run the package!
