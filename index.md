The goal of `polySimIBD` is to perform forwards in-time simulation of malaria population genetics. The model uses a spatial discrete-time, discrete-loci spatial structured Wright Fisher approximation to account for (simplified) malaria transmission dynamics.  


Please see our vignettes for further details on the model formulation and how to run the package!
